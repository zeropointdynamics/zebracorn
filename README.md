==============

NOTICE: This repo is currently experimental. We don't recommend anyone use `zebracorn` quite yet.

Zebracorn is a lightweight, multi-platform, multi-architecture CPU emulator framework
based on a fork of [Unicorn](http://www.unicorn-engine.org).

The Zebracorn engine is primarily made available to support functionality in the [zelos binary emulator](https://github.com/zeropointdynamics/zelos).

Installation

```bash
$ pip install zebracorn
```

Python packages are available for Windows, Linux and MacOS.
